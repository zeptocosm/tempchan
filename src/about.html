<h2><a name="what-is-tempchan">What is Tempchan?</a></h2>
<p><b><a href="/">Tempchan</a></b> is a tool for making throwaway discussion boards, which are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Anonymous</b>: No account is required.</li>
    <li><b>Private</b>: Each board has a secret link, and only people with the link can read or write posts.</li>
    <li><b>Temporary</b>: Everything on the board is deleted after a certain time.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="how-do-i-use-tempchan">How do I use Tempchan?</a></h2>
<p>If you are given a link to a Tempchan board, just load it in your browser and start posting. Or, create your own board by going to <a href="/">the homepage</a> and submitting the form&mdash;your board will be created instantly. Either way, no login is needed!</p>

<h2><a name="what-are-some-situations-where-tempchan-is-useful">What are some situations where Tempchan is useful?</a></h2>
<p>With anonymity, privacy, and temporariness, Tempchan can help you have more open and free-flowing conversations than would otherwise be possible. For example, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share a Tempchan link with your friends or with private chat groups.</li>
<li>Post a link somewhere on the internet (Twitter, Reddit, etc.) where the people you want to talk with are likely to see it.</li>
<li>Use Tempchan for brainstorming within your company or team.</li>
<li>Print out a board's link on posters or cards and advertise it within your neighborhood, school, office, etc.</li>
<li>Create a single-use Tempchan board to stay in touch with someone you just met, without revealing any personal information.</li>
<li>Anything else you can think of!</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="what-are-writeable-and-read-only-links">What are "writeable" and "read-only" links?</a></h2>
<p>Every board has a <b>writeable link</b> and a <b>read-only link</b>. Both links show the same board with all the same posts&mdash;the only difference is whether submitting new posts is allowed. Anyone with the writeable link can both submit and read posts, whereas someone who only has the read-only link can only read and cannot post. (Thus, the read-only link can be shared with a much larger audience than the writeable link.)</p>
<p>When you first create a board, you are taken to its writeable link; from there, there is a link to the read-only link. For convenience, the read-only page may also show the writeable link&mdash;but only if it is already in your history. If you follow a read-only link but have never seen the corresponding writeable link, it will not be shown.</p>

<h3><a name="what-does-writers-only-do">What does "writers only" do?</a></h3>
<p>If you check the box labeled "writers only," the post will be visible only to people with the writeable link, and not to people with the read-only link. When viewed via the read-only link, the post will only appear as <span class="redacted">[Visible to writers only]</span>. Such posts are mainly useful for sharing the writeable link for another board when it is desired that only the writers (and not the readers) of the current board should be able to post on the other board.</p>

<h2><a name="how-does-moderation-work">How does moderation work?</a></h2>
<p>Unless specified otherwise when created, Tempchan boards are <b>Unmoderated</b>. This means that the creator of a board has no special privileges over the other members. Keep this in mind when deciding whom to entrust with your board link!</p>
<p>If a board is marked as <b>Moderated</b>, the creator can set posts as "hidden" as well as mark their own posts with the label "Moderator" (rather than the default "Anonymous"). Such hidden posts appear to others as <span class="redacted">[Hidden by moderator]</span>. However, the board creator still cannot ban people or edit the content of posts, the board title/description, or its lifespan.</p>

<h2><a name="what-are-rolling-and-one-off-boards">What are "rolling" and "one-off" boards?</a></h2>
<p>All Tempchan posts are eventually deleted after a certain time elapses. The board creator has two choices for how this deletion works:</p>
<ul>
	<li>On a <b>rolling</b> board, each individual thread has a fixed lifespan, starting from when its first post is made. After that, the entire thread is deleted (including its later posts which may have been there for only a short time), but the rest of the board's threads remain. The board stays alive as long as people keep posting; however, if the board has been empty with no new posts for the specified time, the whole board will be deleted.
		<ul><li>You can tell a board is rolling because it will show the remaining time for each thread on the main board page, and say "Time till thread deletion:" at the top of every thread page.</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>A <b>one-off</b> board is simpler&mdash;nothing is deleted until the very end of the board's lifespan, at which point the entire board is deleted.
		<ul><li>You can tell a board is a one-off because it will say "Time till board deletion:" at the top of every page.</li></ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>One-off boards are useful if you have a group of people coming together for a single, time-limited purpose, such as for a brainstorming exercise or for planning an event. Rolling boards can be used to have ongoing discussions with a group whose membership gradually evolves as the board link gets spread around.</p>

<h2><a name="why-were-my-boards-title-and-description-deleted">Why were my board's title and description deleted?</a></h2>
<p>The title and description on a <a href="#what-are-rolling-and-one-off-boards">rolling board</a> will eventually expire, although people can still keep posting to it as before. This happens when the first thread (starting with post #1) expires. After that, the board will be titled with a random number (such as "Board 740280") to distinguish it from other boards.</p>
<p>The basic principle of Tempchan is that <i>nothing lasts forever</i>. In keeping with this, even though a rolling board might stay active indefinitely, there is no particular piece of text&mdash;neither a post, nor the title or description of the board&mdash;that will persist. If the title is still in your history, it will be shown <s>crossed out</s> for your personal convenience; however, people who first encounter the board after its title has expired will not see the old title at all.</p>
<p>On a one-off board, the title and description do not expire, because everything will disappear anyway when the board itself expires.</p>

<h2><a name="how-does-the-rss-feed-work">How does the RSS feed work?</a></h2>
<p>To be notified of new posts on a board, you can subscribe with your RSS reader of choice by way of the "RSS" link on the board's homepage. However, because all content is encrypted, the feed will only contain garbled text; in order to read the posts, you must separately load them in your browser. If you follow the links from the feed, you will be able to read the posts as long as the board's secret link is already in your history.</p>

<h2><a name="how-secure-is-tempchan">How secure is Tempchan?</a></h2>
<p>Tempchan is designed to disclose as little information as possible to the people running the site. All posts, board titles, and board descriptions are encrypted locally using the key contained in the secret link, which means that nobody without that link&mdash;not even the server admins&mdash;can read them. The server only sees the date and time of each post, its approximate length, and how the posts are grouped into threads and boards. The secret links are never known by the server; no cookies or analytics are used.</p>

<h2><a name="is-tempchan-being-actively-worked-on">Is Tempchan being actively worked on?</a></h2>
<p>Not really, although new features are occasionally added.</p>

<h2><a name="how-can-i-contribute">How can I contribute?</a></h2>
<p>Tempchan is open-source. You can contribute to the project by opening tickets and pull-requests on <a href="https://github.com/zeptocosm/tempchan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, or by setting up your own instance. The <a href="https://github.com/zeptocosm/tempchan/blob/main/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">README</a> on GitHub also contains a link to a "Tempchan Meta" board where you can leave feedback.</p>

<h2><a name="is-anyone-making-money-off-of-this">Is anyone making money off of this?</a></h2>
<p>No. Tempchan is offered free of charge and without advertisements, in the hope that it will become a widespread tool for improving the quality of conversations online.</p>
